# Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter
## NOTES: 
I used Pinia (https://pinia.vuejs.org/ssr/nuxt.html) to manage store, instead of Vuex because based on the documentation of Nuxt 3, Nuxt no longer provides a Vuex integration (https://nuxt.com/docs/migration/configuration#vuex).


Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# yarn
yarn dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash

# yarn
yarn build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash

# yarn
yarn preview
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
